            <p id="p1">National Cadet Corps (NCC)</p>
            <p id="p2">The National Cadet Corps plays a significant part in moulding a person's character. It fosters
                the
                spirit of teamwork and man-management and leads to the development of a more pleasing overall
                personality.</p>
            <p id="p3">Thus NCC strives to achieve the following objectives:</p>
            <p class="p4">To channelize the energy and dynamism of young men towards activities beneficial to them and
                to the
                society.</p>
            <p class="p4">Constructive use of leisure time, wholesome recreation, wide cultural sympathies, abiding
                social
                consciousness and an alert mind.</p>
            <p class="p4">Recognizing the importance of the NCC, the Institute offers the students an opportunity to be
                part of
                the NCC. The Institute cadets are part of the 3UACTR (3 Uttaranchal Composite Technical Regiment) of
                the NCC and are divided into three companies viz. The Engineers, The Signals and The EME.</p>
